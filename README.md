## Post PCB Order

Getting back into KiCAD after many years away and while focusing on my primary job and life has brought many challenges to this project. Here's the list of items I noted in the design and layout.

* I need a solid workflow for KiCAD for Symbols, Footprints, and library organization
  * I need a plan for how I want my own "Library" and process for making new boards/parts to lower the mental thought needed
  * Symbol checklist
  * Footprint Checklist
  * Sch/PCB Checklist
  * Create a template for OshPark 2/4 layer (and other vendors) to simplify future projects
* The scope of  this project ended up being quite large
* I had very little time outside of work/life to do this that intersected with my want to work on it
  * Break projects into small chunks
  * The multiplexing of jumping into this for an hour and out was very inefficient.
  * Lower the barrier to just getting a PCB in hand, refining my process, etc...
* I need more practice with KiCAD - it's different enough from Altium to be annoying and I'm not up for sitting through issues or planning after a day/week of work.
